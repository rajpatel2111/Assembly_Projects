#Carry out exercises 1.3 (pp55), A.6 and A.8 (pp A-82) from the text book using MARS instead of SPIM. Follows instructions for programming assignments in the syllabus.

#Submit your work for 1.3  in a Word document, and for other exercises in a ZIP file to eLearning by the due date.

#1.3 [2] <Åò1.3> Describe the steps that transform a program written in a high-level language such as C into a representation
#that is directly executed by a computer processor.

#A.6 [5] <ÅòA.9> Using SPIM, write and test an adding machine program that repeatedly reads in integers and adds them into a running sum.
#The program should stop when it gets an input that is 0, printing out the sum at that point.
#Use the SPIM system calls described on pages A-43 and A-45.

#A.8 [5] <ÅòA.9> Using SPIM, write and test a program that reads in a positive integer using the SPIM system calls.
#If the integer is not positive, the program should terminate with the message ÅgInvalid EntryÅh;
#otherwise the program should print out the names of the digits of the integers, delimited by exactly one space.
#For example, if the user entered Åg728,Åh the output would be ÅgSeven Two Eight.Åh
